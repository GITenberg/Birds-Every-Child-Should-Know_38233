description: 'Describes more than 100 common United States birds, including their
  physical attributes, calls, and nesting and mating habits. Describes more than 100
  common United States birds, including their physical attributes, calls, and nesting
  and mating habits. Originally published in 1907, Birds Every Child Should Know is
  a collection of storylike descriptions of more than one hundred birds commonly found
  in the United States. Neltje Blanchan''s detailed descriptions of birds -- their
  physical attributes, calls, nesting and mating habits, and other behaviors -- are
  nothing less than enchanting, and some read almost like fairy tales. Take for instance
  the mockingbird''s call: when the moonlight sheds a silvery radiance about every
  sleeping creature, the mockingbird sings to his mate such delicious music as only
  the European nightingale can rival. Perhaps the stillness of the hour, the beauty
  and fragrance of the place where the singer is hidden among the orange blossoms
  or magnolia, increase the magic of his almost pathetically sweet voice; but surely
  there is no lovelier sound in nature on this side of the sea-or the yellow warbler''s
  nest: an exquisite little cradle of silvery plant fiber, usually shreds of milkweed
  stalk, grass, leaves, and caterpillar''s silk, neatly lined with hair, feathers,
  and downy felt of fern fronds. Blanchan includes folk history (how Native Americans
  and southern slaves thwarted mosquitoes by hanging gourds to attract purple martins)
  as well as common threats to birds that foreshadow current dangers to avian life
  (the toll taken on songbirds by lighthouses and electric towers). Such informative
  details, along with the author''s disarming enthusiasm for her subject, will charm
  adult bird-watchers as well as children. Cornelia Mutel''s informative foreword
  places Blanchan''s writing in the historical context of a turn-of-the-century environmental
  reawakening and burgeoning activism and research by women onbehalf of dwindling
  bird populations.'
